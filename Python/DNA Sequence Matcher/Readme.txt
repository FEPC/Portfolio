DNA Sequence Matcher

Program designed to find the position within a given initial DNA sequence where a specified segment can be appended, identifying the location with the highest number of matches between the sequence and the segment. The program will describe the position, the number of matches, and display the results using the acronyms ACGT to represent the different nitrogenous bases.
